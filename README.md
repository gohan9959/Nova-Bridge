# Nova-Bridge
Nova-Bridge is a dual-language system designed to extract, process, and analyze live game state data from an emulated environment. By bridging Lua-based memory scraping with a C++ logic engine, the project automates the identification of dynamic memory structures to provide a real-time data stream for competitive AI development.
